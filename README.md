# Hypothesis Testing - Factors Affecting Health

## Description
This project involves statistically analyzing surveyed data to test health-related hypotheses and identify key lifestyle factors impacting health. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships between various lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes.

## Objective
- To determine how various lifestyle factors affect Body Mass Index (BMI).
- To evaluate the impact of eating habits, sleep duration, and physical activity on health.

## Data Collection
- Participants: 100 individuals aged between 17 to 56 years.
- Survey: Collected data on age, diet preferences, sleep duration, activeness, and other lifestyle factors.

## Tools and Techniques
- BMI Calculation: Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated for each participant.
- Statistical Analysis: T-statistics and F-statistics were used for hypothesis testing.
- Softwares used:
  1. Data collection via survey form using [Forms App](https://forms.app/)
  2. Analysis conducted using Ms-Excel and Jupyter Notebook

## Hypotheses Tested
1. Age and BMI: Does BMI vary significantly with age?
2. Diet Preferences: Is there a significant difference in BMI between vegetarians and non-vegetarians?
3. Gender Differences: Are there significant differences in BMI between males and females?
4. Fruit Consumption: Does regular consumption of fruits affect BMI?
5. Sleep Duration: Is there a correlation between sleep duration and BMI?
6. Physical Activity: Does regular workout influence BMI?

## Key Findings
- Age: Significant variation in BMI with age.
- Diet: Notable differences in BMI based on diet preferences.
- Gender: Significant gender differences in BMI.
- Fruits: Impact of fruit consumption on BMI.
- Sleep: Correlation between sleep duration and BMI.
- Activity: Influence of physical activity on BMI.

## Results
The analysis provided insights into how different lifestyle factors affect BMI. Significant findings were observed for variations in BMI with age, diet, and activity levels.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the importance of various lifestyle factors in determining health outcomes. Further research with larger sample sizes is recommended to validate and refine these findings.

## Future Work
- Extended Analysis: Include more variables such as stress levels, work environment, and genetic factors.
- Larger Samples: Conduct studies with larger and more diverse populations.
- Interventions: Develop interventions based on findings to promote healthier lifestyles.
